## Getting Started

1. Run the setup script to create a virtual environment, install dependencies, and set up the Jupyter kernel:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```
2. Activate your virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source env/bin/activate
   ```
3. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Use the kernel named `Python (gen-ai-dev-env)` for your notebooks.

All your notebooks should be placed in the `notebooks/` directory.
